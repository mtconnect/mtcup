The C\# Adapter Toolkit is a development toolkit coded in C\#. It was
originally written as a lab for the \[MC\]2 conference, and has been
converted into a class library. The toolkit may be built into a .NET
assembly and referenced to develop an MTConnect Adapter.

The source for this toolkit, along with a complete tutorial for
MTConnect adapter development, may be found at [.NET
SDK](https://github.com/mtconnect/dot_net_sdk) on GitHub.
