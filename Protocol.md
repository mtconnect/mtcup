MTConnect includes a protocol based on HTTP that is outlined in Part 1:
Overview and Fundamentals. See
[1](https://www.mtconnect.org/standard20181).

To use OPC UA as a protocol, see
[2](https://www.mtconnect.org/opc-ua-companion-specification).

Support for MQTT message brokers is expected in a future release.
Additional protocols may be supported by third parties writing their own
Agents.
