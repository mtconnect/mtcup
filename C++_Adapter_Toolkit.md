The C++ Adapter toolkit is the most widely used framework currently in
production. It is a simple socket server library that can be extended to
support most machine tool interfaces. It was originally written to
provide a simple framework to develop from, but has grown through
example.

Open source adapters are found at: [MTConnect
Adapters](http://github.com/mtconnect/adapter).

Many commercial adapters are also available from machine builders,
control manufacturers, and third party developers.
