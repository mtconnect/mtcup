MTConnect Technical Workshop at \[MC\]2, April 2015

Jared Evans & Ben Keifer, MAJiK Systems

MTConnect is built to be a RESTful HTTP Interface. Once your machines
are MTConnect-enabled, anyone within your factory can create
applications that leverage the data available through MTConnect
regardless of programming language. See examples of how modern web
technologies and MTConnect lets manufacturers ditch the spreadsheets and
create applications that are beautiful, blazing fast, secure, and can be
accessed anywhere.
