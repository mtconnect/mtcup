## MTConnect Community

This site is a community portal providing information for implementation best practices for connecting devices on the shop floor with the MTConnect standard. All material contributed on this site becomes part of the public domain licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution 3.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) license.

## MTConnect Standard

The MTConnect standard offers a semantic vocabulary for manufacturing equipment to provide structured, contextualized data with no proprietary format. With uniform data, developers and integrators can focus on useful, productive manufacturing applications rather than translation. Data sources include: machine tools; production equipment; sensors and sensor controllers, and other factory hardware. Applications that consume MTConnect data provide more efficient operations, improved production optimization, and increased productivity.

For more information, please visit the official MTConnect website at [mtconnect.org](https://www.mtconnect.org/).

### How to Get the Standard

Current and archived releases of the MTConnect Standard are free. Find them at [mtconnect.org/documents](https://www.mtconnect.org/documents)

Installing the MTConnect Agent: [Install Agent](/C++_Agent "Install Agent")

### MTConnect SysML Model

Starting with Version 2.0, the normative MTConnect Information Model will be an XMI file rather than text documents.

[Normative MTConnect XMI](https://model.mtconnect.org/MTConnectSysMLModel.xml) : MTConnect Information Model XMI is developed in SysML modeling language using Cameo Enterprise Architect.

[MTConnect Model Browser](https://model.mtconnect.org/) : MTConnect Information Model can be browsed in a report generated from the normative MTConnect XMI.

## For Developers

### What does an MTConnect Architecture look like?

A typical MTConnect architecture has 4 key components: Device, Adapter, Agent and Application. See [mtconnect.org/getting-started](https://www.mtconnect.org/getting-started)

### What if you want to buy MTConnect?

- Check if MTConnect is already supported by your vendor in the list here: [Integrators](https://www.mtconnect.org/step-4-integrators).

  - If your vendor exists on the list, you could either reach out to your vendor or your distributor and ask them if they provide MTConnect products.

- Alternatively, there are also third party system integrators on the list above that sell MTConnect products for new as well as legacy equipment.
