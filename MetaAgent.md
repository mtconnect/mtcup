## MetaAgent

MetaAgent provides support for seamless data integration for MTConnect, NC-Link and OPC UA and any other standards. 

MetaAgent enhances the capability of MTConnect Agent with extension plugins to provide ingress and egress services for other standards. It enforces the MTConnect data semantics and at the same time provides other standards as transport protocols. It gives you the flexibility of utilizing any industry standards in your manufacturing process.
