MTConnect utilizes the right hand rule for all coordinate systems
representing physical space and orientation within a machine. The
positive movement is given by extending the first three fingers on the
right hand and labeling the axes in order of the digits, X, Y, and Z.
The fingers will point in the positive direction. All linear axes
represent a space within a machine that is defined by coordinates
according to the right hand rule.

For Rotary axes, the right hand rule defines the direction of rotary
movement by wrapping one's right-hand fingers around the axis of
rotation. Clockwise rotation points the thumb toward the person, and
counterclockwise rotation points the thumb away. The thumb indicates in
the positive direction of the vector or axis the hand encircles. All
rotational angles and movements are given according to the right hand
rule for Rotary axes.
