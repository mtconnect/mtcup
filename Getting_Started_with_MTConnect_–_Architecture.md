The objective of this document is to capture key considerations for the
implementation of the MTConnect standard to a wide variety of
manufacturing equipment (e.g. machine tools) representing many different
generations of technology. This guide does not address requirements for
implementing software applications that use data conforming to the
MTConnect standard. It does, however, discuss a number of issues to be
considered in planning your project and for preparation for discussions
with third-party solution providers who implement solutions compliant to
the MTConnect standard. No vendor specific hardware or software
solutions will be highlighted in this Connectivity Guide - only
guidelines that should be evaluated by anyone considering the
implementation of MTConnect on their production floor have been
described.
