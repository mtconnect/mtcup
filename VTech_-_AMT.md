## An MTConnect Use Case Study at the Virginia Tech Learning Factory

AMT and Virginia Tech are working together to grow and accelerate
companies starting their digital manufacturing journey. While
digitization and data sciences can be overbearing, creating a prototype
cell is a fast and easy way to understand these new technologies. In
this collaboration over several years with the Virginia Tech Learning factory, the following listed projects were completed by groups of
undergraduates implementing MTConnect.

- [Rize One and Rize XRIZE MTConnect Adapters](https://github.com/mtconnect/vtech_learningfactory_haas_rize1_xrize_adapter).
