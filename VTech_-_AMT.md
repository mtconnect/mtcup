## An MTConnect Use Case Study at the Virginia Tech Learning Factory

AMT and Virginia Tech are working together to grow and accelerate
companies starting their digital manufacturing journey. While
digitization and data sciences can be overbearing, creating a prototype
cell is a fast and easy way to understand these new technologies. In
this collaboration with the Virginia Tech Learning factory, a group of
undergraduates implements MTConnect on a Haas three-axis mill. This
report outlines practical information for your implementation.
