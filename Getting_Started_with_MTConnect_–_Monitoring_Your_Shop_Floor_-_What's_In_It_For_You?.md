AMT - The Association For Manufacturing Technology

The purpose of this document is to demonstrate the tangible benefits of
monitoring a manufacturing plant, and of using the open and royalty-free
standard called MTConnect as a the way to get information off the sho
floor.

This white paper discusses a number of issues to be considered when
determining what the tangible business benefits of machine monitoring
ark and describes what adopters of MTConnect have already experienced.
It also provides preparation for discussion with internal stakeholders
or external third-party solution providers, and hopefully assists in
removing any barriers to MTConnect adoption. This guide does not address
third-party vendor-specific requirements for implementing software or
hardware applications that use data conforming to the MTConnect
standard.
