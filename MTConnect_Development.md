# Building your own MTConnect Solution?

## What is required?

The basic elements of an MTConnect architecture are:

- Device
- Adapter
- MTConnect Agent
- Application

See [White Paper on MTConnect Architecture](/Getting_Started_with_MTConnect_â€“_Architecture "wikilink") for more details on commonly seen implementations.


## What is available?

- MTConnect Agent.
  - Most MTConnect implementations use the open source C++ Agent available on MTConnect GitHub. See [C++ Agent](/C++_Agent "wikilink") to learn about the C++ Agent.
- Examples for Adapter. See
  - [Adapter Examples](https://github.com/mtconnect/adapter)
  - [PocketNC Adapter](https://github.com/mtconnect/PocketNC_adapter)
  - [ISO Digital Twin Project](https://github.com/mtconnect/iso_digital_twin_adapter)
